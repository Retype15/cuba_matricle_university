The following year shows a slight increase, establishing a solid foundation for the growth to come.\n\n*   **Sustained Growth to the Peak (2017-18 to 2020-21):** Starting from the 2017-18 academic year, and despite the lack of data for 2018-19, the upward trend resumes strongly until it reaches its **highest point in the 2020-2021 academic year, exceeding 285,000 students**.

Enrollment remains high but no longer grows, and by 2022-23, the decline becomes more evident.\n\n*   **Recent Adjustment (2023-24 to 2024-25):** The last two recorded academic years show a **continuation of the downward trend**, with total enrollment standing at around **205,000 students** in the most recent period.

They start with significant enrollment (around 30,000), experience remarkable growth to exceed **65,000 students in 2020-2021 and 2021-2022**, becoming the second-largest branch during those years. However, they suffer a sharp decline in recent years, finishing near 40,000 students.\n\n*   **Consistent Intermediate Block:** A group of branches maintains a stable presence, albeit with fluctuations:\n    *   **Technical Sciences** (pink line) and **Social and Humanistic Sciences** (light blue line) show parallel trajectories, growing from approximately 20,000 students to a peak of around **30,000-32,000** between 2020-21 and 2021-22, then declining to around 23,000-25,000 students at the end of the period.\n    *   **Economic Sciences** (red line) show more moderate but constant growth until 2021-22 (reaching about 24,000 students), followed by a decline similar to other branches, ending near 15,000.\n    *   **Agricultural Sciences** (dark blue line) and **Physical Culture and Sports Sciences** (dark green/brown line) remain in a lower range, generally between 5,000 and 15,000 students, with peaks around 2020-2021 and subsequent declines.\n\n*   **Specialized Niche:** **Natural and Mathematical Sciences** (purple line) and **Arts Sciences** (violet line) represent the branches with the lowest enrollment volume, consistently staying below 5,000 students throughout the decade.

It starts as a significant portion, expands significantly to represent the second-largest proportion (reaching almost **25-30%** of the total around 2019-2021), but then reduces its percentage share in recent years.\n\n*   **Relative Stability in the Middle:** Technical Sciences (brown/ochre band), Social and Humanistic Sciences (light blue band), and Economic Sciences (dark blue band) maintain more stable proportions over time, though with slight variations. Together, they usually make up a significant portion of the student body. For example, Social and Humanistic Sciences seem to consistently occupy around 10-15%.\n\n*   **Lower Percentage Weight:** The other branches (Agricultural, Physical Culture, Natural and Mathematical, Arts) individually represent smaller percentages of the total enrollment, which is consistent with their lower absolute student volume.\n\nThis percentage analysis is crucial because it allows us to understand not only how many students are in each branch, but also how interest or admission capacity is distributed in relation to the entire university system.",

This could indicate that the medical sector, while having its own dynamics, also benefits from or participates in broader expansionary trends in higher education.\n    *   **Technical Sciences** also correlate moderately with most other branches, suggesting a connection with the overall system cycle.\n\n*   **Noteworthy Relative Independence:**\n    *   **Natural and Mathematical Sciences** stand out for having the **lowest correlations** with almost all other branches (coefficients often between 0.2 and 0.4). This indicates that their enrollment growth pattern seems to be quite independent of the fluctuations affecting other large areas of knowledge. This branch could be influenced by very specific factors, such as particular scientific promotion programs or a more specialized and less sensitive demand to general trends.\n    *   **Arts Sciences** also show weaker correlations with some of the larger branches like Pedagogical Sciences, although it has an interesting moderate correlation with Medical Sciences.\n\n*   **Strategic Implications:**\n    *   The strong synchronization between certain branches suggests that planning and resource allocation strategies could consider these behavioral \"clusters\".\n    *   The independence of Natural and Mathematical Sciences might require a differentiated approach and monitoring to ensure their vitality and alignment with the country's scientific-technical development needs.\n    *   The absence of strongly negative correlations (in this chart) suggests that, at the aggregate level of annual change, there is no evident \"cannibalization\" where the growth of one branch is directly at the expense of another, although competitive dynamics at more specific levels are not ruled out.",

  "conclusion_findings_subheader": "üåü Highlights of the Journey: Main Findings",
  "conclusion_findings_text": "Looking back at our analysis, several beacons emerge to guide our understanding:\n\n1.  **The Nation's Dynamic Pulse:** National university enrollment has shown a remarkable capacity for expansion, reaching significant peaks in the early 2020s, followed by a more recent adjustment phase. This fluctuation reminds us of the system's sensitivity to contextual factors and the need for flexible planning. *(Ref. Section 1)*\n\n2.  **The Medical Heart and the Pedagogical Soul:** **Medical Sciences** are consolidated as the backbone in terms of student volume, a testament to their strategic importance. **Pedagogical Sciences**, on the other hand, have shown extraordinary dynamism, with massive growth followed by a contraction, reflecting possible changes in demand or teacher training policies. *(Ref. Section 2)*\n\n3.  **The Rise of New Vocations:** The growth analysis (CAGR) has revealed the impressive takeoff of careers like **Dental Services** and the vigor of several **Engineering** fields (Artistic, Agro-industrial Processes, Computer Science), signaling potential new frontiers of interest and labor demand. *(Ref. Section 3)*\n\n4.  **Progress and Challenges in Gender Equity:** While Cuba exhibits high female participation in higher education, with many branches and careers showing a majority of women, significant challenges remain. The underrepresentation of women in **Technical Sciences** and **specific Engineering fields**, as well as in **Physical Culture and Sports Sciences**, calls us to redouble our efforts to build a truly equitable landscape. *(Ref. Section 4)*\n\n5.  **The Richness of Institutional Diversity:** Each university brings its unique nuance to the system. We have seen everything from large multidisciplinary centers to institutions with marked specialization (like the Universities of Medical Sciences). The identification of careers with limited offerings underscores the importance of a coordinated and strategically distributed university network. *(Ref. Section 5)*\n\n6.  **A Prudent Look at Tomorrow:** The projections, though subject to the uncertainty inherent in the future, suggest a possible continuation of the adjustment phase in general enrollment and in several key branches and careers. This is not an omen, but an invitation to preparation and proactive action. *(Ref. Section 6)*\n\n7.  **The Importance of Details:** The analysis of \"Areas of Attention\" has reminded us that the health of the system also lies in the vitality of each of its components, including emerging careers, those with low enrollment, or those that might be concluding their cycle. *(Ref. Section 7)*",
